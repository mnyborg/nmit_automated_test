# Automated Testing with Jest + GitHub Actions

This template is for learning how to set up automated testing using Jest and GitHub Actions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the tests locally:

   npm install  
   npm test

3. Make changes to sum.js or __tests__/sum.test.js
4. Commit and push
5. GitHub will automatically run your tests using GitHub Actions

## Your Task

- [ ] Modify the sum function to handle more cases
- [ ] Add at least one more function with its own test file
- [ ] Watch your CI pipeline in the Actions tab

## Bonus Challenges

- Add a new test that fails, then fix it
- Add a status badge to this README:
  ![Test Status](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

## Success Criteria

- Your tests run automatically on GitHub
- Failing tests show up in the Actions tab
- You understand how CI fits into modern development
